shopping-list
==============

A simple exercise in learning the following technologies/techniques/things:

- Using ES2015 with Node
  - Accomplished by transpiling code with babel prior to running it.
  - Using Gulp to do so
- Using Waterline ORM
  - This allows different databases to be used
- ExpressJS for running the server/API
- ReactJS to render the front-end
- Falcor to feed the data to the front-end
- JSDoc to document the functions

The application itself is a simple shopping list.
It will simply show a list of items that have been added to the list
and keep track of the price of a given item if it has been purchased
before.
